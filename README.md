## Baseball Sorter

  A program that takes input from three exteranl text files (team names, associated leagues, world series winners). The teams are then Â   sorted into the two different leagues, and output as part of their league with their associated World Series wins.
  
## POS System

  A program to simulate a POS system for a restaurant. This was done as part of a group project. I was in charge of menu integration and adding items to the order. After my designated section was completed, I helped my two other teammates complete their portions. The program uses an external text file for the menu which it reads and uses. There are also implementations for manager tools and some minimal reports.
  
## Text Adventure

  This program is a take on the old school text adventures that were around before computer graphics advanced enough to provide GUIs. It is a simple game where you travel around the map gathering different items that can be used at other locations. THe goal of the game is to gather the 4 specific items and go to the specified location to win. There is a specific order in which many of the items must be gathered. There is also a time element built on a limited number of turns. There is also a small combat element in one of the locations.
